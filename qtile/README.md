# Qtile

* This is my repo for my Qtile setup. It has my config.py, my autostart.sh, picom.conf as well as my sxhkdrc file
* Please note that you will need to install the qtile-extras package as well as the python-dbus-next package for everything to work correctly.

## Autostart & Picom

* Create a directory named "scripts" inside of your Qtile directory
* You will want to place the autostart.sh and picom.conf files in a the 'scripts' directory within the Qtile directory

## Sxhkd

* Create a directory titled "sxhkd" within your Qtile directory
* Insert your 'sxhkdrc' file within the "sxhkd" directory, from there you can edit that file with your favorite text editor and change any of the keybindings that you like
